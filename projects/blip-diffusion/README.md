## BLIP-Diffusion: Pre-trained Subject Representation for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation and Editing
This repo will host the official implementation of BLIP-Diffusion, a text-to-image diffusion model with built-in support for multimodal subject-and-text condition. BLIP-Diffusion enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subjects with up to 20x speedup. In addition, BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combiend with ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.
